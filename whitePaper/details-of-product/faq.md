## Ensuring Data Integrity and Security

**Q: What happens if a model attempts to maliciously acquire original data through training?**\
A: We mitigate this risk through stringent model governance. All models must pass a review conducted by Curators before being allowed on the platform. This process ensures that only models meeting our strict criteria for integrity and safety gain access.

**Q: What if a malicious model passes the review by mistake?**\
A: In the unlikely event that a malicious model bypasses the review, it will lose its staked assets. This penalty serves as a deterrent against malicious intentions and ensures that stakeholders act in the best interest of the platform’s community.

**Q: Who performs the role of Curators?**\
A: Initially, the platform's official team will act as Curators, applying a rigorous review process to each model. This role may expand to include trusted members of the community as the platform evolves, maintaining a high standard of data protection and model integrity.

**Q: How does the review process protect data owners?**\
A: The review process is designed to prevent any model that could potentially compromise data privacy or security from accessing the platform. By requiring models to be vetted by Curators, we ensure that data owners’ information remains protected against unauthorized access or malicious use.

**Q: Are there any additional safeguards in place?**\
A: Yes, beyond the curatorial review, we have implemented a system of stakes and penalties to discourage malicious activity. Models that act against the platform's policies face significant consequences, reinforcing a secure and trustworthy environment for all users.
